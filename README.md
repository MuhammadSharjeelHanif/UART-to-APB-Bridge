# UART to APB Bridge (SystemVerilog + UVM)

This project implements a **UART to APB bridge** that decodes 8-bit UART transactions into APB protocol operations and sends appropriate responses back over UART. It includes both RTL and UVM-based verification.

The design was developed and verified during my internship at **DreamBig Semiconductor**, focusing on both **RTL design** and **functional verification**.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective:** To enable communication between a UART master and an APB-based peripheral by designing a hardware bridge in SystemVerilog.
- **Protocol:** UART input is parsed and decoded to generate corresponding APB read/write transactions.
- **Response:** The APB response (ACK or read data) is sent back over UART.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **UART RX/TX**
  - 8-bit data, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit
  - Baud rate divisor calculation based on 100 MHz clock
  - Data synchronization for both the driver and rx module so that rx picks the value, the same time as driver drives it. Same is done for tx and monitor.

- **UART Packet Format**
  - 8-bit UART Transaction: `[7:3] data`, `[2:1] address`, `[0] R/W bit`
  - `R/W = 1` ‚áí Write, `R/W = 0` ‚áí Read
  - [start bit (0)] , [data bits (7-3)] , [address bits (2-1)] , [write enable (0th bit)] , [stop bit (1)]

- **APB Master Interface**
  - Generates `PADDR`, `PWDATA`, `PWRITE`, `PSEL`, `PENABLE` based on UART packet
  - Waits for `PREADY` and reads `PRDATA` for read operations

- **UVM Verification Environment**
  - Includes UART input/output monitor, UART driver, APB output monitor, scoreboard, and sequencer
  - Supports directed and randomized sequences
  - Current design is giving 3 write operations on seperate slave addresses and then 3 read operations from the addresses where it was written.
  - APB input monitor and driver classes are made that can be used in future if APB signals are to be manually generated.

## üîÆ Future Recommendations
- **Support for variable UART data lengths** (e.g., 7-bit, 9-bit) and parity bits.
- **Baud rate configurability** through APB registers instead of fixed values.
- **Multi-byte transactions** for higher throughput.
- **Integration with multiple APB slaves** using an address decoder.
- **UVM functional coverage enhancement** to measure verification completeness.
